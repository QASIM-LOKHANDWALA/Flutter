# blog_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

This is the project which I am using to learn clean architecture in flutter.

The blog application allows the user to read blogs either online or offline using database and local storage.

The database used to store login credentials in Supabase which is a light and fast way to store data.
